/**
 * A one-way connection between two child states of a particular state.
 *
 * Transitions define a target state, or "to" state, an optional origin state, or
 * "from" state, and an optional target state, or "to" state. A transition is triggered
 * when the containing state receives an event that matches the transition's event ID,
 * if it has one, and if the type of the containing state's active child matches the
 * transition's origin state, if it has one. However, transitions must at least have
 * either a trigger event or an origin state.
 *
 * When a transition is successfully performed, the active child of the containing
 * state is exited, and the target state defined by the transition is entered. The
 * target state becomes the contaning state's new active child.
 *
 * As mentioned previously, transitions may choose not to define an origin state.
 * These transitions are known as unbound transitions, and may be performed
 * regardless of which child of the containing state is active. Only one unbound
 * transition for any given event ID may be contained within a state.
 *
 * Additionally, transitions that define origin states may instead choose not to
 * define a trigger event. These are known as live transitions. States containing live
 * transitions will attempt to perform them every time their CallUpdate() method is
 * called. Only one live transition for any given child of a certain state may be
 * contained within said state.
 *
 * Transitions may define a condition to be fulfilled before the transition may
 * be performed. Transitions that are not performed due to their condition not
 * being fulfilled will not cause the event that triggered them to be consumed.
 * Transition conditions are given access to the data object of the machine that
 * owns the containing state, such that they may use this data in the condition
 * logic.
 *
 * Transitions may define custom behavior to be executed upon being performed
 * successfully. This behavior is executed after the containing state's active
 * child is changed, but before the new active child is entered. Transition
 * behaviors are given access to the state that performed the transition, such
 * that they may modify state data or propagate additional events.
 *
 * Ordinarily, the target state's active child is reset to default when a transition
 * is successfully performed. However, transitions may choose to allow the target
 * state to bypass this reset and keep the active hierarchy of its descendants intact.
 * These are known as branch-resuming transitions.

/**
 * A single unit of logic in a hierarchical finite state machine.
 *
 * States may contain any number of child states, and consider only one of these children
 * to be active at any given time. Any individual lineage of children in a state machine
 * is known as a branch.
 *
 * A state that contains children will define a default child. Typically this is
 * the first child added to the state. The lineage of all children in the containing
 * machine that are considered active at one time is known as the active branch.
 *
 * States may define behavior to be executed upon the state initially becoming
 * active, behavior to be executed on demand, and behavior to be executed upon
 * becoming inactive. These are known as entry, update, and exit behaviors
 * respectively. Entry and update behaviors are executed top-to-bottom: the
 * outermost states execute first, while the innermost states execute last.
 * Exit behaviors, however, are executed bottom-to-top.
 *
 * States may also define transitions between children, which change the active
 * child of the state.
 *
 * States may propagate events up and down the hierarchy of active states.
 * Events are defined as simple names. Upon receiving an event, A state may
 * choose to respond by executing custom behavior or performing a transition.
 * Said state may also consume the received event. An event is consumed when
 * the receiving state performs a transition in response, or when the state
 * responds with custom behavior that explicitly declares the event consumed.
 * A state that does not consume a received event via custom behavior may still
 * consume the event by performing a transition. Events that are consumed do
 * not propagate any further.
