Mod by Joe 'Joblez' Salem

MUtil created by Magdiel, creator of various features, assisted in development (make code look good)

This mod uses Nashgore by Nash Muhandes, all assets involving the blood are made by him

this also uses vsonnier's port of thezombiekiller's footsteps, modified by Magdiel012

If an asset has no credit here, it's likely I (Joblez) made it. There are sounds, sprites,
and textures for this mod by me. There are also a handful of sounds that use a sample that are in the
Public Domain. I will attempt to credit as many public domain samples as possible but there may be
some missing.
